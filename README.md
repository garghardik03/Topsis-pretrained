# Topsis for Pretrained Models

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) for evaluating pretrained text generation models. The text generation models used in this project are sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models), a popular library for natural language processing.

In this code, we have utilized the following text generation models:

- distilgpt2-small
- gpt2-small
- gpt2-medium

## Installation

To run this code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

To evaluate the pre-trained Text Generation models, using TOPSIS, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required libraries provided in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Run the `topsis.py` file using the following command:

```bash
python topsis.py
```

3. Review the results of the TOPSIS evaluation for the pre-trained models.

## Results

The results of the TOPSIS evaluation for the pre-trained models are as follows:

Rank | Model Name | TOPSIS Score |
